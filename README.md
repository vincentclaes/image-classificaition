# multimodal-modeling-image-to-text

Trying multimodal modeling image to text, it turned out not to be that easy.
I ended up doing image classification and fine tuned a model in the mit indoor scenes dataset.

- look at [image-classification.ipynb](image-classification.ipynb) to see how we use a pretrained model for image classification.
- look at [image-classification-finetuning.ipynb](image-classification-finetuning.ipynb) to see how we finetune our model on a datatset.
